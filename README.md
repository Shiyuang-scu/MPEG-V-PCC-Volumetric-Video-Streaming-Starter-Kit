# MPEG-V-PCC-Volumetric-Video-Streaming-Starter-Kit

Welcome to the MPEG V-PCC Volumetric Video Streaming Starter Kit! This repository is designed to help students and researchers get started with volumetric video streaming using MPEG V-PCC, also known as Video-based Point Cloud Compression.

Volumetric video is an emerging technology that allows viewers to experience video content in 3D, with the ability to move around and explore the scene from different perspectives. MPEG V-PCC is a standard developed by the Moving Picture Experts Group (MPEG) for compressing point cloud data, which is used to represent 3D objects and scenes in volumetric video.

This repository includes a variety of learning resources to help you understand the basics of volumetric video streaming with MPEG V-PCC, including:
- An overview of the MPEG V-PCC standard and its key features
- Tutorials and code samples for encoding, decoding, and streaming MPEG V-PCC content
- Links to relevant research papers and articles on the topic
- A list of tools and software that can be used for working with MPEG V-PCC and volumetric video

Whether you're a student just starting to explore the world of volumetric video, or a researcher looking to dive deeper into the technical details of MPEG V-PCC, this starter kit has something for you. We hope you find it helpful and informative, and we welcome your feedback and contributions to help make it even better.
